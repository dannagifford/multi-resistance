To perform the statistical analyses and figure plotting associated with BIORXIV/2019/643585 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643585v1)
You will need R (https://cran.r-project.org/). Packages needed are loaded by the scripts, but you may need to install them first.

To perform the full analysis and generate all figures:
- first run 'munging.R' to get data into needed formats
- then run 'model-fitting.R' for statistical models (will take time)
- then run 'plots.R' for plots

Otherwise you can open the scripts and generate analyses and figures on an individual basis.
