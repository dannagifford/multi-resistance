To perform the statistical analyses and figure plotting associated with BIORXIV/2019/643585 (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643585v3)
You will need R (https://cran.r-project.org/). Packages needed are loaded by the scripts, but you may need to install them first.

To perform the full analysis and generate all figures:
- first run 'munging.R' to get data into needed formats
- then run 'model-fitting.R' for statistical models (will take time)
- then run 'plots.R' for plots

You will likely need to install packages before running the scripts (commented out at the top of each script).
You can open the scripts and generate analyses and figures on an individual basis.
